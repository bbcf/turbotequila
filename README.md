Description
====================
TurboTequila is a Turbogears application with Tequila enabled.

First use
=====================
Download the project :

    $ git clone git://github.com/bbcf/turbotequila.git

(It will create a directory named `turbotequila`)

So you want to use another name for your project, like `myCoolProject`.

    $ cd turbotequila
    $ python init_project.py myCoolProject
    $ cd ..
    $ cd mycoolproject

Now as you will work on a python environment I suggest you to use [virtualenv](http://example.net) and the [wrapper](http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper).
It will create an isolated environment for your project. (You may want to skip this step).

Once your are in the right environment:

    $ easy_install -i http://tg.gy/215 tg.devtools
    $ python setup.py develop
    $ paster setup-app development.ini
    $ mv who.ini.sample who.ini
    $ paster serve --reload development.ini

These lines will:
    
    * install the turbogears development tools
    * install the libraries needed by turbotequila
    * setup the database
    * move the authentication sample file to the right name (You MUST edit this file)
    * serve the application on localhost:8080 by default


Enjoy ;)
